559. Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree

Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

Solution:

"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=None, children=None):
        self.val = val
        self.children = children
"""

class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: 'Node') -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        maxdepth=0
        for child in root.children:
            maxdepth=max(self.maxDepth(child),maxdepth)
        return maxdepth+1
