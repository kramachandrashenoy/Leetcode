        """
        :type words: List[str]
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        result = []
        set1 = set("qwertyuiop")
        set2 = set("asdfghjkl")
        set3 = set("zxcvbnm")
        for word in words:
	        w = set(word.lower())
	        if w.issubset(set1) or w.issubset(set2) or w.issubset(set3):
		        result.append(word)
        return result
